## üß† Aim
To perform **Content Creation** (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) using various **Prompt Patterns** to analyze how prompt design influences AI-generated content.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm
This experiment demonstrates how different prompting techniques such as **Query Decomposition**, **Decision-Making**, and **Semantic Filtering** can be effectively used to generate diverse forms of content such as reports, articles, case studies, and creative works like comic books using **ChatGPT** or similar AI models.  
The main objective is to highlight how structured prompting techniques improve the **quality**, **coherence**, and **organization** of generated outputs.

## üìã Procedure

| Step No. | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **1** | Open ChatGPT or a similar AI-based content generation platform. |
| **2** | Select the type of content to be produced (Report, Article, Case Study, etc.). |
| **3** | Apply **Query Decomposition** to divide complex queries into smaller, meaningful sub-prompts. |
| **4** | Use **Decision-Making Prompts** to allow the AI to make logical or creative choices while generating responses. |
| **5** | Implement **Semantic Filtering** to ensure the generated content stays relevant to the main topic. |
| **6** | Generate and compare multiple outputs by changing the prompt structures. |
| **7** | Evaluate how each prompting method influences the quality, structure, and clarity of the generated content. |

## üß© Prompting Techniques Used

| Technique | Description | Application |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Query Decomposition** | Dividing a complex prompt into smaller sub-prompts for better organization. | Useful for reports, case studies, and structured documents. |
| **Decision-Making Prompts** | Allowing the AI to make creative or logical choices to enhance content flow. | Effective in storytelling, articles, and creative content. |
| **Semantic Filtering** | Restricting AI responses to stay contextually and semantically relevant. | Ideal for technical and academic writing. |

## üßæ Example Demonstration

| Content Type | Prompt Technique Used | Outcome |
|---------------|-----------------------|----------|
| Report | Query Decomposition | Produced well-structured and coherent sections. |
| Article | Decision-Making | Generated engaging and logically connected paragraphs. |
| Case Study | Query Decomposition + Semantic Filtering | Focused, precise, and relevant content. |
| Comic Story | Decision-Making | Creative and consistent storyline with clear flow. |

## ‚úÖ Result
The designed prompts were executed successfully.  
The generated outputs clearly demonstrated how **different prompting techniques** influence the **coherence**, **structure**, and **overall quality** of AI-generated text.

---

## üìö Conclusion
Effective **Prompt Engineering** enhances the performance and reliability of AI content generation systems like ChatGPT.  
By utilizing techniques such as **Query Decomposition**, **Decision-Making**, and **Semantic Filtering**, users can produce **clearer, more relevant, and well-structured** content across various formats, including reports, articles, case studies, and creative works.
